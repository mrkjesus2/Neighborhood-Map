# Mark's Neighborhood Map

## About

This is an app built with knockout.js using the Google Maps, FourSquare,
Wikipedia, and Google Places API's. It shows parks, museums, and galleries
that are around my neighborhood as well as interesting information about
those places.

I used Web Starter Kit for the build tools, but mainly because browser-sync
is awesome! Have all of your phones, tablets, computers and any other browser enabled devices you own open to the development server and see what I mean!
