# Mark's Neighborhood Map

## About

This is an app built with knockout.js using the Google Maps, FourSquare,
Wikipedia, and Google Places API's. It shows parks, museums, and galleries
that are around my neighborhood as well as interesting information aobut
those places.

I used Web Starter Kit for the build tools, but mainly because browser-sync
is awesome!
